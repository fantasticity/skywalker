SkyWalker
==============

### Introduce

SkyWalker is a proxy program, which supports to transform certain-protocol network flow into another one.

For example, if you have a client that only supports HTTP-PROXY protocol, but a proxy server that only supports SOCKS5 protocol.

Then you can use SkyWalker to transform HTTP-PROXY flow into SOCKS5 flow. like below

```
+--------+                +-----------+            +---------------+
| CLIENT | <=HTTP-PROXY=> | SKYWALKER | <=SOCKS5=> | SOCKS5 SERVER | <=>
+--------+                +-----------+            +---------------+
```

To do this, SkyWalker should be configured to accept HTTP-PROXY data but output SOCKS5 data.


### Definition

There are two main parts in SkyWalker, Client Agent and Server Agent.

*    Client Agent works as a proxy server, to accept specified proxy data from client and transfer to SA.

*    Server Agent works as a proxy client, to generate specified proxy data from server and transfer to CA.


### Protocol

For now

CA supports

    * HTTP PROXY
    * SOCKS4
    * SOCKS5
    * SHADOWSOCKS

SA supports

    * SOCKS4
    * SOCKS5
    * SHADOWSOCKS
    * DIRECT



DIRECT is a special protocol, actually it's not a protocol, it directly outputs the data from CA.

If SA is configured to DIRECT, then SkyWalker just works like a normal proxy.

### Configuration

SkyWalker uses [Yaml1.2](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html) as configuration format.

Check ***example*** directory for configuration examples.

### Build

To build SkyWalker, you need a [GO language](http://golang.org/) compile environment.

Go to the source code directory and execute:

*    make
